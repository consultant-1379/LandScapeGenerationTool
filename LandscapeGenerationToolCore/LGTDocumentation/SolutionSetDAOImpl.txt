@Repository and @Autowired are Spring Annotations.

@Autowired is used to autowire the dependency of the SolutionSetDAOImpl on the SessionFactory.
          
 
            The @Repository annotation is used to indicate that a class
            functions as a repository and needs to have exception translation
            applied transparently on it. The benefit of exception translation
            is that the service layer only has to deal with exceptions from
            Springs DataAccessException hierarchy, even when using plain JPA
            in the DAO classes.
            
            The service layer classes are annotated with @Service to facilitate
            processing by tools or anticipating any future service-specific capabilities
            that may be added to this annotation.
